# @allmaps/allmaps

100,000s of maps are available through [IIIF](https://iiif.io/), across libraries, archives and museums worldwide. Allmaps makes it easier and more inspiring to **curate, georeference and explore collections of digitized maps**.

To see how these apps and packages are related, check out the [dependency graph](https://observablehq.com/@allmaps/javascript-dependencies).

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js (version 20.8 or higher) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack) installed.

First, clone this repository locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/allmaps/allmaps.git
cd allmaps
```

Then, install dependencies and create symlinks:

```sh
pnpm install -r
```

Finally, initialize SvelteKit apps:

```sh
pnpm run check
```

## Running packages and apps locally

### All packages and apps

To run the `watch` and `dev` scripts for all packages and apps, run the following in one terminal window:

```sh
pnpm run watch
```

And this in another:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

### A single app

To run the `dev` script for a single app, you need to run the `watch` scripts of all packages in one terminal window:

```sh
pnpm run watch
```

And then run the `dev` script of the app in another:

```sh
pnpm --filter "@allmaps/viewer" run dev
```

You can also run the `dev` script from the app's directory instead:

```sh
cd apps/viewer
pnpm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

If things don't work, it might help to reinitialize the SvelteKit apps:

```sh
pnpm run check
```

Or, reinstall dependencies and create the monorepo's symlinks:

```sh
pnpm install -r
```

As a last resort, you can try to remove some (or all) `node_modules` directories using [npkill](https://npkill.js.org/):

```sh
pnpm dlx npkill
```

## Commit changes

This repository uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to run type checking, code linting and tests before each commit.

To skip these tests, you can use git's `--no-verify` option:

```sh
git commit --no-verify
```

## Check formatting and types

Check TypeScript types for all packages:

```sh
pnpm run types
```

Run [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for all packages:

```sh
pnpm run lint
```

## Run tests

Run tests for all packages and apps:

```sh
pnpm run test
```

Run tests for a single package:

```sh
pnpm --filter "@allmaps/transform" test
```

You can run the tests from the package's directory instead:

```sh
cd packages/transform
pnpm test
```

# Versioning & publishing

Create prerelease versions:

```sh
lerna version prerelease
```

Publish beta versions to npm:

```sh
lerna publish from-git --dist-tag beta
```

Promoting unchanged pre-release versions:

```sh
lerna version --conventional-commits --conventional-graduate
```
