## Internet Archive

As of September 2023 the IIIF API of the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) was upgraded in collaboration with the IIIF Consortium. The implementation is still under development and some items might throw an error when opening them in Allmaps. Please notify us when this happens and we'll make sure to investigate and publish a fix when possible.

Some collections containing maps:

- [Center for Sacramento History](https://archive.org/details/cshmaps)
- [United States Geological Survey](https://archive.org/details/maps_usgs)
- [Digital Piranesi](https://archive.org/details/digital-piranesi-v17)

#### Open in Allmaps

Please enter a valid URL below to an object in the Internet Archive. Please note that IIIF Collection Manifests are currently not supported in Allmaps.
