# Annotated Code Block test

This is the annotated code block.

<AnnotationCodeBlock
  client:load
  code="console.log('vivianhelloworld')"
  key="test"
>
  <Code code="console.log()" slot="code" lang="js">
    
  </Code>
  <Annotation highlight={[1]}>Notes can be written in the MDX</Annotation>
  <Annotation highlight={[3]}>
    They will highlight as they're scrolled
  </Annotation>
  <Annotation>And these are being injected with a Svelte slot</Annotation>
  <Annotation>
    Things that need to be done still: making this render as markdown, finding a
    styling library for the code block, and the highlighting code feature
  </Annotation>
  <Annotation>
    When an annotation gets highlighted, it needs to communicate with the code
    block which lines get highlighted. Maybe a context can be used to
    communicate this information?
  </Annotation>
  <Annotation>
    Or can it be done with class manipulation? How will the code component know
    that lines are highlighted?
  </Annotation>
</AnnotationCodeBlock>
