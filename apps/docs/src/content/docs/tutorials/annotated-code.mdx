# Annotated Code Block test

This is the annotated code block.

<AnnotationCodeBlock
  client:only="svelte"
  codeFile="hello"
  includePlaceholder={false}
>
  <Annotation highlight={[1]}>Notes can be written in the MDX</Annotation>
  <Annotation highlight={[2]}>
    They will highlight as they're scrolled. Line 3 should be highlighted here.
  </Annotation>
  <Annotation highlight={[3]}>And these are being injected with a Svelte slot</Annotation>
  <Annotation highlight={[4]}>
    # This already gets rendered as markdown!

    But custom icons if we want them still need to be added :)

    Also maybe styling should change to accomodate the smaller surface size. (and :::note doesn't work!)

    
  </Annotation>
  <Annotation highlight={[4, 5]}>
    When an annotation gets highlighted, it needs to communicate with the code
    block which lines get highlighted. Maybe a context can be used to
    communicate this information?
  </Annotation>
  <Annotation highlight= {[1, 3, 5]}>
    Some notes about authoring this content type: the highlight array needs to have a space between each comma and item.
    The AnnotationCodeBlock component **must** be client:only!

    The code file is being saved in code-snippets -- but the endpoint is sending back a hardcoded string right now
  </Annotation>
</AnnotationCodeBlock>

# This is the second annotation code block

<AnnotationCodeBlock
  client:only="svelte"
  codeFile="hello"
  includePlaceholder={true}
>
<Annotation>
Testing to see what happens if there are two annotation code blocks
</Annotation>
</AnnotationCodeBlock>
