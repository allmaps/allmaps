Georeferencing refers to the process of matching digital images with the geography of the real world by assigning geospatial positioning information to the image based on a defined coordinate system.[(1)](#foot1) The georeferencing process involves assigning x, y coordinates as control points to the digital image (or, raster file) and matching them to control points on an existing georeferenced data set.[(2)](#foot2) Control points are recognizable locations that can be accurately identified on both the digital image as well as in real-world coordinates, such as street corners, parks, or river intersections.[(3)](#foot3) Ground control points (GCP’s) are coordinates that the computer will use to associate pixel space in an image with geographic space in a modern web map, thus allowing a user to match a digital cartographic image file to real-life geography.[(4)](foot4) A georeferenced digital map or image has been tied to a known Earth coordinate system, so users can determine where every point on the map or aerial photo is located on the Earth's surface.[(5)](#foot5) In other words, georeferencing allows a user to position a digital image, such as a historical map, in its specified location in the real world using GIS software that aligns the digital image with other georeferenced data.

Georeferencing is a requisite task for all spatial data, as spatial data cannot be positioned in space or evaluated with respect to other georeferenced data without first being assigned spatial coordinates within a defined coordinate system.[(6)](#foot6) Files that do not contain any geographic data or spatial reference information—such as scanned maps, photographs, and historical data—require users to manually generate geographic coordinate information through georeferencing so that it can be viewed, queried, and analyzed with other geographic data.
