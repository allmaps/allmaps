## What is IIIF?

IIIF (pronounced “triple-eye-eff”), or the International Image Interoperability Framework [(iiif.io)](https://iiif.io), is a set of open standards for delivering high-quality, attributed digital objects online at scale. IIIF is a way to standardize the delivery of images and audio/visual files from servers to different environments on the Web where they can then be viewed and interacted with in many ways.[(1)](#foot1) It enables richer functionality beyond just viewing an image or audio/visual file and allows users to work across barriers.
 
There are six IIIF APIs (Application Programming Interface) that work together to offer users endless possibilities for engaging with IIIF supported digital images. The two main components to IIIF—delivering digital objects to sites and viewing them—are achieved through the Image API and Presentation API. The Image API defines how image servers deliver image pixels to a viewer. It retrieves images from anywhere in the world and allows the user to select and edit an area of the image. The Presentation API attaches basic metadata and structure to digital objects, defining how they appear in viewers. It packages each image with its metadata and structural information into the Manifest, which is the prime unit in IIIF which lists all the information that makes up a IIIF object.
 
Institutions across the world are adopting IIIF to provide access to their collection of digitized images. With Allmaps, you can georeferenced any map from any institution that supports IIIF.
