# Allmaps \- IIIF Partnership

Contribute to the open source Allmaps ecosystem as part of your IIIF membership by becoming an Allmaps Supporter or Innovator.

Allmaps is an ecosystem for working with IIIF maps, plans and aerial photos. It turns IIIF images into interactive map layers which can be overlaid and compared. Data is encoded through Georeference Annotations – an official extension to the IIIF APIs – and openly licensed. Allmaps is modular and can be tailored to fit existing workflows or institutional requirements. Its ultimate goal is to **make digitized maps accessible and to provide an interface for exploring *all* IIIF maps across collections as open data.**

An **Allmaps Supporter** pays $2,000 on top of their IIIF annual membership fee and receives the following benefits\*:

* **Add your collection of maps to Allmaps**, where it can be georeferenced by the crowd in Allmaps Editor. Suggestions from your collection will appear on the Editor’s landing page;
* **Keep track of your maps that have been georeferenced with Allmaps**. Through an API and Allmaps Latest you can keep track of the crowd-sourced data in Allmaps, and export it to your own systems at any time;
* **Offer a custom flow to your patrons**. When linking to Allmaps from your institutional page, users will see your institutional branding and a backlink to your collections;
* **“Open in Allmaps” button**. A customizable component you can add to your collection interface to indicate if a map has been georeferenced, and to open the resource in different parts of Allmaps.
* **Training and support**. Allmaps offers one in-person training as part of the IIIF Annual Conference and one remote training as part of the Online Meeting. Support is offered through the \#maps and \#allmaps channels in the IIIF Slack.

\* *These benefits will be expanded on a yearly basis through the work sponsored by the Innovators. For non-institutional members (without holdings), please contact the Allmaps team to discuss alternative benefits.*

An **Allmaps Innovator** pays $10,000 on top of their annual IIIF membership fee and receives the same benefits as Allmaps Supporters, plus:

* Support the development of new apps and features within the Allmaps ecosystem that will open up to other members and the world;
* Have a seat on the Allmaps Advisory Board and determine the annual roadmap in consultation with the Allmaps team;
* Obtain beta access and offer feedback to new apps and features;
* Contribute to establishing a governance structure for Allmaps.

*Allmaps Supporters and Innovators can reconsider their contribution on a yearly basis. The partnership between IIIF and Allmaps runs for three subsequent years (2026-28) after which it will be evaluated by the IIIF Executive Committee before continuation. 11.5% (in 2026; 12% from 2027 onwards) of the fee will be reserved for administrative costs.*

## Frequently Asked Questions

– Why Allmaps?

Digitized maps draw the interest of patrons. Maps are best found *by location* and preferably studied *in comparison to other maps*. While many collections include maps, few institutions have the in-house GIS expertise required to improve their accessibility.

Allmaps is *IIIF-first* and does not require specific infrastructure or expertise to turn digitized images into interactive maps. In fact, patrons are encouraged to do this by themselves. The only institutional requirement is the IIIF Image API, and, preferably, the IIIF Presentation API.

Since Allmaps only generates lightweight annotations and no heavy derivatives (see below), it becomes much easier to share maps and to create collective portals to search across collections. For advanced use cases, it offers tooling to analyse and compare maps, or to import them into GIS applications.

Alternative options rely on expert knowledge, generate derivatives, are closed source, or do not grant access to data. But supporting Allmaps is by no means exclusive and can be complemented with other workflows depending on institutional needs to patrons’ preferences.

Allmaps is purposefully not called a platform, since platforms are easy to jump on but difficult to jump off. By focusing on modularity and data sovereignty, Allmaps has been developed as an open and extendable ecosystem rather than a singular, closed platform.

– Why the IIIF-Allmaps Partnership?

One of the benefits of IIIF is the ability to share codebases across implementations. Over the past ten years many open source tools developed by institutions and commercial partners have seen uptake within the IIIF Community as a whole. The sustainability of such tools has often been a challenge. Through the introduction of membership top-ups, the IIIF Consortium aims to play a more active role in organizing durable support for open source projects that benefit the community. It also promotes IIIF membership by offering dedicated services in return.

For Allmaps, the partnership marks the start of a new phase. While the project has been generously supported by various institutions through a series of grants, structural maintenance has been a concern as more and more institutions and individuals rely on the ecosystem. Securing its open source and open data character, the Allmaps team is keen on developing a funding structure that offers dedicated services to partners without compromising its core values and creating too much overhead. The partnership with IIIF Consortium is the logical outcome of this process.

– What is georeferencing?

Georeferencing relates a couple of points (pixels) in an image to geospatial coordinates. These are called *control points*. The process often also includes cropping the image to the part containing the map. This is called the *mask*.

Based on three or more control points, it’s possible to interpolate all the other points in the image. This can be used to transform between pixels and geospatial coordinates.

Georeferencing usually results in new versions (or derivatives) of the original image. Allmaps stores the control points and mask in a light-weight and standardised Web Annotation, and produces derivatives on the fly.

– How is Allmaps organised?

Allmaps is a collaboration between Delft University of Technology Library and independent developer and cartographer Bert Spaan; both based in the Netherlands. Institutional partners and independent contractors have significantly contributed since its founding in 2021\. Allmaps is currently establishing a legal entity for its maintenance and further development, while preserving the commitment to open data and open source. This process is monitored by the Allmaps Advisory Board that will also represent the interests of other IIIF Consortium members.

The Advisory Board is the first step in formalizing the governance structure of Allmaps, and will be filled with single representatives from each Innovator, Glen Robson from the IIIF Consortium, Jules Schoonman from TU Delft, and Bert Spaan. The board will also include representatives from other long-term institutional partners of Allmaps who are not (yet) members of the IIIF Consortium. The Advisory Board will meet twice annually.

## Acknowledgements

The partnership between Allmaps and the IIIF Consortium grew out of a series of informal discussions and meetings held during the [Open Maps Meeting](https://openmapsmeeting.nl/) (The Hague, November 2024), [Allmaps Public Convening](https://lmec-ws.observablehq.cloud/allmaps-news/2024-convening) (Boston and online, November 2024), [Colocate2 Unconference](https://davidrumseymapcenter.github.io/colocate/) (Stanford, February 2025\) and the [IIIF Annual Conference](https://iiif.io/event/2025/leeds/) (Leeds, June 2025).

The plans gained momentumThe importance of the Allmaps-IIIF partnership was underscored after the Trump Administration [terminated](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/neh-allmaps-statement-2025/) a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grant on April 17, 2025 that had been awarded to the Leventhal Map & Education Center (LMEC, Boston Public Library) and the American Geographical Society Library (AGSL, UWM Libraries) for the further development of Allmaps. An Allmaps Planning group consisting of representatives from the IIIF Consortium staff, Executive Committee, Maps Community Group, Allmaps, LMEC and AGSL has held regular meetings to work out the structure of the partnership. It was approved by the Executive Committee in October 2025\.
