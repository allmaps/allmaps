    <Card title="Works with any IIIF map" src="allmaps-editor" href="https://editor.allmaps.org/#/collection?url=https://cdm21033.contentdm.oclc.org/iiif/info/krt/2175/manifest.json">
      <p>
      More and more institutions across the world are adopting <a href="https://iiif.io/">IIIF</a> to provide access to
      their collections of digitized images. Among all these images are 100,000s of maps.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Allmaps, you can georeference any map from any institution that supports IIIF. Allmaps doesn't require
        complicated GIS infrastructure and it doesn't need to generate XYZ map tiles. All that's needed is a IIIF server.
      </p>
    </Card>

    <Card title="Built on open standards" src="georef-annotation" href="https://iiif.io/api/extension/georef/">
      <p>
        All components of Allmaps use <a href="https://iiif.io/api/extension/georef/">Georeference Annotations</a>
        that hold each map's georeference data. Georeference Annotations are based on W3C's
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">Web Annotation standard</a> and are an
        <a href="https://iiif.io/api/index.html#approved-extensions">approved extension</a> to the IIIF Presentation API.

    <Card title="Client-side map warping" src="allmaps-viewer" href="https://viewer.allmaps.org/?url=https://annotations.allmaps.org/images/a7afe9a34c3b8633">
      <p>
        Allmaps can warp maps on-the-fly, in the browser. Allmaps functions without the need to first create image derivatives
        such as GeoTIFFs or map tiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        To warp a map, Allmaps uses the <a href="https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/#4-image-requests">IIIF Image API</a> to only
        download the portion of the image that's needed, in the right scale.
        <a href="https://viewer.allmaps.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fannotations.allmaps.org%2Fmanifests%2Fc390af06ea724803">Allmaps Viewer</a> can stitch maps that are composed of multiple sheets together in real-time.

    </Card>

    <Card title="More than displaying map layers" src="annotorious" href="https://observablehq.com/@allmaps/allmaps-and-annotorious">
      <p>
      But Allmaps is not just about warping images and displaying map overlays: it's about open standards and open data. A
      Georeference Annotation can be used to display a warped map, but there's much more Allmaps can do with this data.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can build geospatial indexes to quickly find the maps you're looking for, improve tools for

      <p>
        All that's needed to georeference a map with <a href="https://editor.allmaps.org/">Allmaps Editor</a> is the
        URL of a <a href="https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/#22-image-information-request-uri-syntax">IIIF Image</a> or
        <a href="https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#52-manifest">IIIF Manifest</a>. You don't need to create an account or
        to first upload and import images.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://viewer.allmaps.org/">Allmaps Viewer</a> just needs the URL of a Georeference Annotation to warp a
        map. Allmaps Editor and Allmaps Viewer are simple static sites that don't need a database or GIS infrastructure to run â€” just a IIIF server.

    <Card title="Open source components" src="github" href="https://github.com/allmaps">
      <p>
        The core components of Allmaps are open source and will always be freely available. The most important goal of the project
        is to make maps more accessible, from map collections from institutions big and small.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our plugins for <a href="https://maplibre.org/">MapLibre</a>, <a href="https://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> and
        <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> make it easy to display georeferenced maps on

        Allmaps works with any IIIF resource that can be georeferenced. Maps hiding out as illustrations in books, newspapers or
        archival folders can be edited and viewed as well. Or other types of documents such as
        <a href="https://viewer.allmaps.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsammeltassen.nl%2Fiiif-manifests%2Fallmaps%2Frivierahal-blijdorp.json">architectural

        You can use Allmaps to study the past, but also to present contemporary maps or future proposals. In
        <a href="https://cityatlas.theberlage.nl/">education contexts</a>, it can be used to study a site accross different
        times and scales.

## Getting started

<Steps>

1. Find a map in the digital collections of an institution or public repository that supports IIIF. For example:

    - [Leventhal Map & Education Center](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=)
    - [American Geographical Society Library](https://collections.lib.uwm.edu/digital/collection/agdm/search/searchterm/)
    - [Leiden University Libraries](https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/islandora/search?type=dismax&islandora_solr_search_navigation=0&f%5B0%5D=RELS_EXT_isMemberOfCollection_uri_ms:%22info%5C:fedora%5C/collection%5C:ubl_maps%22)
    - [Library of Congress](https://loc.gov/maps)
    - [Internet Archive](https://iiif.io/guides/guides/archive.org/)
    - Many other institutions around the world with IIIF-enabled map collections can be found in [this list](https://github.com/allmaps/iiif-map-collections).

2. Find the URL of the IIIF resource of the map you want to use and copy the URL to your clipboard. Often, you can find this URL by clicking the <img class="w-5 !inline top-0.5 relative" src={IIIFLogo.src} alt="IIIF" /> logo somewhere on the web page that displays the digitized map.

3. Open the map in [Allmaps Editor](https://editor.allmaps.org/) by pasting its IIIF URL:

    <UrlInput
      client:load
      placeholder="URL of IIIF Manifest or IIIF Image"
      baseUrl="https://editor.allmaps.org/?#/collection?url="/>

    The Leventhal Map & Education Center has published [a tutorial](https://www.leventhalmap.org/projects/digital-projects/georeferencing/) about georeferencing maps from their collections using Allmaps.

4. View the resulting Georeference Annotation in [Allmaps Viewer](https://viewer.allmaps.org/):

    <UrlInput client:load placeholder="URL of Georeference Annotation" baseUrl="https://viewer.allmaps.org/?url="/>

5. Use the Georeference Annotation in our [plugins](#plugins) for MapLibre, OpenLayers or Leaflet.
    With [Allmaps Tile Server](https://observablehq.com/@allmaps/allmaps-tile-server) you can display the georeferenced map in applications like QGIS.

## Tools

- [Georeference Annotation](https://iiif.io/api/extension/georef/): specification of the data format used by Allmaps.
- [Allmaps Editor](https://editor.allmaps.org/): georeference a map by entering the URL of a IIIF resource.
- [Allmaps Viewer](https://viewer.allmaps.org/): view georeferenced maps by entering the URL of a Georeference Annotation.
- [Allmaps Latest](https://latest.allmaps.org): the latest maps georeferenced with Allmaps.
- [Allmaps CLI](https://github.com/allmaps/allmaps/tree/main/apps/cli): command-line interface for Allmaps.
- [Allmaps Tile Server](https://observablehq.com/@allmaps/allmaps-tile-server): proxy server that generates an XYZ map tile
  layer from one or more Georeference Annotations. You can use the Allmaps Tile Server to display warped maps in applications like QGIS.
- More tools and experiments can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/allmaps) and [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@allmaps).

### Experiments

- [Allmaps Here](https://dev.here.allmaps.org): shows georeferenced maps around your current location.
- [Allmaps Explore](https://dev.explore.allmaps.org): experimental interface for exploring all maps georeferenced with Allmaps, built with [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com/).

### Plugins

Allmaps provides plugins for the three most widely-used JavaScript mapping libraries.
By loading a Georeference Annotation you can display a georeferenced IIIF map with just a few lines of code.

<Libraries />

### Developers

The core functionality of Allmaps is published on npm as individual JavaScript packages:

- [`@allmaps/annotation`](https://github.com/allmaps/allmaps/tree/main/packages/annotation): parses and generates Georeference Annotations.
- [`@allmaps/project`](https://github.com/allmaps/allmaps/tree/main/packages/project): transforms and projects pixel coordinates to projected geospatial coordinates
    (and vice versa) using the ground control points (GCPs) from a parsed Georeference Annotation.
- [`@allmaps/render`](https://github.com/allmaps/allmaps/tree/main/packages/render): renders georeferenced maps with WebGL,
    with the Canvas API or as raw pixel values.
- [`@allmaps/id`](https://github.com/allmaps/allmaps/tree/main/packages/id): uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to turn
    IIIF URLs into the identifiers used internally by Allmaps.
- More packages and apps can be found in the [Allmaps monorepo](https://github.com/allmaps/allmaps) on GitHub.

## Open data

Allmaps publishes the georeference data of __all maps__ georeferenced with Allmaps Editor as open data in different formats.
This metadata contains the ground control points (GCPs), the clipping mask and pointers to the map's IIIF resource.
